Task was to create a HTML/CSS/JS application that presented student grades in a specified manner. A styled button was to be created which calculated each student's final grade upon click. 
Additional tasks were to create functionality via JavaScript such that all final grade averages automatically updated whenever a change was made to any student's grade. It was also asked of me to 
tell users how many unsubmitted assignments existed. Finally, each cell where student scores could be entered were to be validated using JavaScript.
